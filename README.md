# Multimeasure
This is the code for https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Smart_Home_Sensors_8a8fcac7.html

This hardware and software allow you to build a multi measure device that measure temperature, humidity and light - then send it to a MQTT server.

It can be easily integrated with HomeAssistant and other smart home tools that works with mqtt.

This project was done with my son Netanel.
